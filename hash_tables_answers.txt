What is a hash table?

Hash table is a type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs.

What is hashing?

Hashing is a process of converting arbitrary data into a fixed-length hash code using a hashing function.

How does a hash table store data?

Hash tables, like arrays, are intended to be used as collections of similar data. They are commonly used to store data by some form of identifier.

How are hash tables and objects different?

Hash tables are used to store different instances of data by some form of identifier. 
Objects hold potentially different types of data bundled together. Each piece of data is tied to a property name, and that property determines the type of data. 

Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

A list of pets and their unique names. - Hash Table
The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend. - Object
The name and location of every company in a given city. - Hash table
All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual. - Hash table
The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact. - Object

CODING QUESTIOINS


1. Create a hash table that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers.

class Customer {
   constructor(name, address, phoneNumber) {
      this.name = name;
      this.address = address;
      this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
   }

	getHash() {
		return parseInt(this.phoneNumber);
	}
}

let customerList = [];

let kendall = new Customer('Kendall', 'Broomfield', '2391112233');

let daria = new Customer('Daria', 'Broomfield', '2392223456');

2. Create a hash table that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory and quantity.

class Inventory {
	constructor(item, count, serial) {
		this.item = item;
		this.count = count;
		this.serial = serial;
	}

	getHash() {
		return parseInt(this.serial);
	}
}

let inventoryList = [];

let table = new Inventory('Table', '4', '38011345680');

inventoryList[table.getHash()] = table;


3. Create a hash table that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date.


class Articles { 
	constructor(copy, publisher, pubDate) {
		this.copy = copy;
		this.publisher = publisher;
		this.pubDate = pubDate;
	}

	getHash() {
		return this.pubDate + ' ' + this.publisher;
	}
}

let compiledArticles = {};

let newArticle = new Articles('Global Warming and Coral Reefs', 'National Geographic', '06-15-2018');

compiledArticles[newArticle.getHash()] = newArticle;

console.log(compiledArticles)
