Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a kind of structured English for describing algorithms. It allows the designer to focus on the logic of the algorithm without being distracted by details of language syntax.

 

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Pseudocode is meant for humans to read rather than machines, so it will not run on a computer. 



Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:



Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT a number
IF number one is greater than number two THEN
  PRINT "Number one is greater than number two."
ELSE
  PRINT "Number one is less than number two."
END IF

function greater(num1, num2) {
  if(num1 > num2){
    console.log(num1 + " is greater than " + num2 + ".")
  } else {
    console.log(num1 + " is less than " + num2 + ".")
  }
}



Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT number to 0
WHILE the number is less than or equal to 100
  INPUT the next number
END WHILE
RETURN number

var num = 0;

function loop(){
  while(num<=100){
  num++;
  }
  console.log(num)
}



Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INIT phonebook with numbers inside
INIT i to 0
FOR the length of the phonebook is less than i
  IF number in phonebook = number we are searching for
    PRINT "Found number ..."
END FOR
PRING "Number not found."


var phonebook = [2816671666, 4696320000, 8002141111];


function numberSearch(number) {
    for(var i=0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
        if(phonebook[i] === number) {
            console.log("Found number " + number + ".");
        }
    }
    console.log("Number not found.");
}

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
