1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

The stack data structure arranges elements in LIFO priority. The queue data structure arranges elements in FIFO priority.

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

The Stack and Queue both are the Non-primitive data structures.
Stack and queue is linear data structures they both stores sequentially.
Insertion and Deletion operation can be performed on Stack as well as in Queue.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

I would use stack data structure because it implements a LIFO priority collection which is perfect for creating Undo and Redo buttons.

PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

function reverse(original) {
  var stack=[];
  for(var i=0; i<original.length; i++) {
    stack.push(original[i]);
  }
  var reversed='';
  while(stack.length>0) {
    reversed += stack.pop();
  }
  return reversed;
}


2.Implement the pop method of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure. Since the internal list is not the same as defined in the checkpoint, it may help to rewrite the pseudocode first.

const Queue = function() {
  this.storage = {};
  this.count = 0;
}
  Queue.prototype.enqueue = function (value) {
    if (value) {
      this.storage[this.count] = value
      this.count++
    }
  }

  Queue.prototype.pop = function() {
    if (this.count === 0) {
      return undefined
    }

    this.count--
    let result = this.storage[this.count]
    delete this.storage[this.count]
    return result
  }

  Queue.prototype.size = function() {
    return this.count
  }
  


let newQueue = new Queue()
newQueue.enqueue("push")
newQueue.enqueue("pop")
newQueue.enqueue("delete")
newQueue.pop()
